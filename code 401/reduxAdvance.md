# Readings: Redux Advance

- **Redux** is an open-source JavaScript library for managing application state. It is most commonly used with libraries such as React or Angular for building user interfaces.

- **Redux Toolkit** is our official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development. It is intended to be the standard way to write Redux logic, and we strongly recommend that you use it.

- Redux Toolkit makes it easier to write good Redux applications and speeds up development, by baking in our recommended best practices, providing good default behaviors, catching mistakes, and allowing you to write simpler code.

# createSlice

- A function that accepts an initial state, an object of reducer functions, and a "slice name", and automatically generates action creators and action types that correspond to the reducers and state.

- createSlice accepts a single configuration object parameter
