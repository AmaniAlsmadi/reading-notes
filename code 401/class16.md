# Advanced State with Reducers

1. How can we ensure that an effect hook runs only once?

 - can pass an empty array as the second argument to the useEffect hook to tackle this use case.
 ```
  useEffect(() => { // Side Effect }, []);
  ```
   In this case, the side effect runs only once after the initial render of the component
   

2. Can useState() update more than one state variable at the same time?

  - we won't be updating two states every time and if we do that, most probably we want to mix those states into one.


3. Is useState() synchronous?

   - Â useState is an asynchronous hook

## Vocabulary Terms

- State Hook: useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components.

- Component Lifecycle: The lifecycle of a component is the series of methods that are invoked in different stages of the component's existence.

- useEffect(): The Effect Hook, `useEffect`, adds the ability to perform side effects from a function component. It serves the same purpose as `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` in React classes, but unified into a single API.

- Reducer: A reducer is a function that determines changes to a state. It uses the action it receives to determine this change. and re-render the component every time you call it.
