1. What is a ‘call’?
- It is a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).
2. How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?
- once,It is single-threaded
3. What does LIFO mean?
-  Last In, First Out,it means that the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out, when the function returns.
4. Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.
- 
5. What causes a Stack Overflow?
- when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point.

1. What is a ‘reference error’?
- an error when a variable that doesn't exist (or hasn't yet been initialized) in the current scope is referenced
2. What is a ‘syntax error’?
- an error in the syntax of a coding or programming language, entered by a programme
3. What is a ‘range error’?
- It's thrown when trying to pass a value as an argument to a function that does not allow a range that includes the value
4. What is a ‘type error’?
- an error when an operation could not be performed, typically (but not exclusively) when a value is not of the expected type.
5. What is a breakpoint?
- It's a point in the program where the code will stop executing.
6. What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?
- I can see the “history” before reaching that breakpoint.I can start to see why it is useful, I know the function add was executed in which line, with what parameters and I can evaluate whatever will well me at that point in the console.
