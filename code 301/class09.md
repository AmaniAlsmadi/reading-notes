1. What is functional programming?
- Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
- The first fundamental concept we learn when we want to understand functional programming 
- It returns the same result if given the same arguments
3. What are the benefits of a pure function?
- The code’s definitely easier to test. We don’t need to mock anything. So we can unit test pure functions with different contexts:

      -Given a parameter A → expect the function to return value B
      -Given a parameter C → expect the function to return value D
A simple example would be a function to receive a collection of numbers and expect it to increment each element of this collection.


4. What is immutability?
- Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.

5. What is Referential transparency?
-
         pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency
